# E-commerce Back End Project 

## Project Description 
In this project, we are building the back-end of an e-commerce website. We developed the models and API routes to understand some of the fundamentals of buidling e-commerce websites.

## Acceptance Criteria 

- GIVEN a functional Express.js API WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable fileTHEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize 
- WHEN I enter schema and seed commands THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
- WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
- WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
- WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
